# SARS-CoV2-Animated-Cases-and-Viral-Load

For this plot, daily new cases are calculated using PCR-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections.  Data come from the the Virginia Dept. of Health Coronavirus database (https://www.vdh.virginia.gov/coronavirus/).

Viral loading data in wastewater were generated by Hampton Roads Sanitation District (HRSD). For these data, grab samples were collected from the raw influent of 
9 treatment facilities in the Hampton Roads region of Southeastern VA.  Viral concentrations were scaled by influent flow at the time of collection and aggregated for all 9 plants to generate a regional viral load characterizing approximately the same spatial extend as the clinical cases for the region.
